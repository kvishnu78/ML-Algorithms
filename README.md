# ML-Algorithms
The notebooks have implemntations of different machine learning algorithms using the wine quality dataaset, and the performances are analyzed based on different scenarios.
Also there are some preprocessing techniques that are applied.
Dataset:
Combined dataset from UCI repository taken from, https://www.kaggle.com/rajyellow46/wine-quality
Red wine data for models that need smaller dataset, https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009
